One graph vertex with, say, 200 edges is a dot in 200-dimentional space with value 1 in all those dimentions.

How would you interpret adjacent vertices?

A graph can be viewed as an area in a multidimentional space. In the vast magnitude of possible combinations it tracks paths to areas that have sence in relation to the observed reality.
