I've got busy preparing slides for the presentation that I'm going to deliver in London. I've chosen the dark theme because it's soothing for eyes. Some slides are perceived as animations when they go one after the other. Important stuff gets highlighted.

I hope that the conference organazer won't require to change th aspect ratio.
