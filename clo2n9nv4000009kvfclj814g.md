The previous blog post was about small things. Now let's increase the size a little bit. Let's consider the numbers 65535 and 65536. In binary form they are written like this: 1111111111111111 and 10000000000000000 respectively. The first number consists of 16 ones and the second number contains 16 zeros. It's easy to see with this example how a binary graph is built. The root vertex is at the top of the picture. The actual vertices that mean 65535 and 65536 are 53 and 56.
